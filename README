Game of Life
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project is a graphical implementation of the Game of Life in Java. It
targets OpenGL using LWJGL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building and running

To build, compile each class with the lwjgl.jar file in the class-path. By
default, the code will set the library-path property of lwjgl to a native/
directory, which should hold the native shared libraries for lwjgl. You may
change this in case you have the library installed on your system somewhere
else.

A manifest file is provided (GameOfLife.mf) that can be used for making a jar
file. You should include lwjgl.jar and the native libraries alongside this jar
file.

To run the program, run the GameOfLife class, or the jar file you created. Make
sure it can find lwjgl.jar and the native libraries.

Patterns

This repository contains a directory of pattern files. Pattern files specify
initial game states to load. Each line in the pattern file is mapped to the
center of the game board. So you need to pad each line with spaces (' ' or '.')
to ensure that everything matches up. The software tries to fit your input into
the center of the board (in both dimensions).
